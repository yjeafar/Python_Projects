# Python_TicTacToe
TicTacToe in Python that is played in bash

Created a full tic tac toe game with player vs player or player vs computer that is played in the terminal. This is my first full Python project (I created a website in Django as well), so I used this to better understand the basics of Python as I continue to strengthen my skills with the language. I avoided hard coding things as best I could and it is very scalable. Making it take any length and width board would require little rework.

To play, just download the file, cd to its location, and run: python TicTacToe.py 
If you have any questions or come across something odd, please let me know! 
Thanks for taking the time to look at my project! (:
